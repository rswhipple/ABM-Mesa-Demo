In this document, we are practicing how to make a quarto book.

We will describe the data and include file locations.

In this section I use data from [test.xlsx](https://github.com/FoodSystemsModeling/CityFoodPolicy/tree/main/data_raw).

We need to figure out if we link to the folder or to the file directly, which is more helpful?

Things to include in the written description, think about it like the data and methods section of the paper (including detailed footnotes): 
  - any changes to the data (e.g., if you dropped outliers, then describe the process by which outliers were identified and how many observations were dropped)
  - 
  -
